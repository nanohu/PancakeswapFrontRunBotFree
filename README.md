## About front-running in crypto
Front running has fundamentally and unfortunately, evolved into multi-billion-dollar ethical malpractice of entering into an equity trade, option, futures contract, derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, non-public knowledge of a large pending transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security or coin.

## Prerequisities
- Node and NPM https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Wallet with BNB for gas and token swap.
- Windows 10 and above for windows setup

## Running BOT
